TODOVI
Run:
Backend: node server.js

Deploy via Vercel. Does this work with static? Consider neocities - more hobbyist deployment
Page per user to start, no log in
-Add leo_SAIT user (convert Notepad)

Make usable without wifi (have backup database in data.json, upload to database when reconnect).
Redis/in-memory database.

Start with list of tasks separated by day.
Commands for status, highlight.

Ideas for app:
-Like Notepad++ where move cursor around, Ctrl+X to remove line, etc.
--use cursor control to add commands to code each line (yellow/orange/red/blue/green/purple/pink)
-Like Excel where commit cell
-Sort each day by time (untimed float to top [unless moved?])
-different pages of app
--TODO list
--$$$$ - queries Robinhood API, potentially scrapes Chase (login)
--Books/Media
