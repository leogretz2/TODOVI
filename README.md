TODOVI
Deploy via Vercel. Does this work with static?
Page per user to start, no log in.
-Add leo_SAIT user (convert Notepad)

Make usable without wifi (have backup database in data.json, upload to database when reconnect).
Redis/in-memory database.

Start with list of tasks separated by day.
Commands for status, highlight.

Ideas for app:
-Like Notepad++ where move cursor around, Ctrl+X to remove line, etc.
-Like Excel where commit cell
-Sort each day by time (untimed float to top [unless moved?])
